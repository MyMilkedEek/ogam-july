* ISSUES
- [ ] SW bug: cutLines are not drawn over SW border, but they are
  drawn over NE border. (They should never be drawn over catwalk
  borders)
- [ ] Calculate subobjective bug: In one case, I got a "-1 array out
  of bounds" segfault. needs to investigate.

* TASKLIST
- [ ] *Ship* - remove "goal selection" from "do tap" and move it to
  "update". In this way, the ship won't need a copy of LC anymore.
** Graphics
- [ ] "Game Drawer" object to draw gameplay elements
- [ ] Widgets for the interface
** Interface
- [ ] Game over if number of lives is 0
- [ ] Level gets more difficult
- [ ] About/tutorial/hints
- [ ] Quit game
** Gameplay
*** Game
- [ ] Add score
- [ ] Add number of player lives (increases with score?)
- [ ] End level when screen smaller than a certain size
- [X] Zoning defined on the number of enemies
*** Enemies
- [ ] Think and add more interesting enemies
- [ ] Speed/size of enemies change with level size
- [ ] Player-following enemy
- [ ] Line-following enemy
- [ ] Shooting enemy

** DONE Simple Enemies (07/21)
- [X] Level sends a signal when it changes size
- [X] Add simple bouncing enemy dies if outside the path
- [X] Add Player death (send player to closest position in path) 
- [X] Add simple bouncing enemy kills player on line contact (07/21)
- [X] Add simple bouncing enemy (07/21)
- [X] Add GameEnvironment Class with all the model instances (07/21)
- [X] Test new path for collinear points and remove them. (07/21)
- [X] Cutlines should stop crossing: loops are deleted when crossing cutlines. (07/21)
- [X] Add catwalk cutting after cutline is finished (selection conditions) (07/21)




* WISHLIST
- [ ] In "Ship": should probably separate the logic that chooses a new
  position (direction) from the logic that moves the ship to this new
  position. Probably need also to create a new function to validate
  the new position (when trying to go out of the field)
