* ISSUES
- [ ] SW bug: cutLines are not drawn over SW border, but they are
  drawn over NE border. (They should never be drawn over catwalk
  borders)

* TASKLIST
- [ ] Make cutlines stop crossing (should the ship die if the cutlines
  cross? or just delete the loops?)
- [ ] Add basic catwalk cutting after cutLine is finished

- [ ] Do the rest of the game :-)


* WISHLIST
- [ ] In "Ship": should probably separate the logic that chooses a new
  position (direction) from the logic that moves the ship to this new
  position. Probably need also to create a new function to validate
  the new position (when trying to go out of the field)
