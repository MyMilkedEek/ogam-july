* ISSUES
- [ ] SW bug: cutLines are not drawn over SW border, but they are
  drawn over NE border. (They should never be drawn over catwalk
  borders)

* TASKLIST
- [ ] Test new path for collinear points and remove them.
- [ ] Add simple bouncing enemy
- [ ] Add GameEnvironment Class with all the model instances
- [X] Cutlines should stop crossing: loops are deleted when crossing cutlines. (07/19)
- [X] Add catwalk cutting after cutline is finished (selection conditions) (07/19)




* WISHLIST
- [ ] In "Ship": should probably separate the logic that chooses a new
  position (direction) from the logic that moves the ship to this new
  position. Probably need also to create a new function to validate
  the new position (when trying to go out of the field)
