== What is it ==

This is a game project for the *One Game a Month* challenge
(July-13). This is a collaborative effort between Eek and Claus.

The basic idea of the game is to be a Qix clone.

== Game Outline ==

+ *Gameplay*: Qix Clone
+ *Theme*: TBD
+ *Quirks*: TBD

== Game Interface ideas ==

+ Swipe the screen to define directions for the ship to move. The ship
will turn at each intersection between the swipe semi-lines

+ Touch the screen to determine the next destination of the ship. The
ship will move along the most distant axis first, then the closest
axis to the destination.
E : To summarize: touch navigates the ship around the level, swiping creates a line for the shape the ship will claim

+ Virtual keyboard
E : I wouldn't go with a virtual keyboard. In landscape, this takes up too much screen and in portrait it will look dumb... cramped

+ Other ideas?

== Tasks == 
+ [ ] Gameplay Prototype.
+ [ ] Break the tasks down into something more actionable.
